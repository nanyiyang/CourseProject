Degree from Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1968 and graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with a Ph.D. in Computer Science in 1974. Since then he has been a faculty member in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Oregon. His research interests have been in artificial intelligence and graph theoretical models of communication networks. Realted to artificial intelligence, he has conducted research on problem solving and planning, qualitative reasoning, models of argumentation, and artificial evolution. In networks, his research has considered issues of efficient network design for both message dissemination and robustness of network connection as well as basic questions in graph theory. Research Dr. Arthur M. Farley is currently conducting research in two areas: Artificial Evolution, and Algorithmic Graph Theory. Artificial evolution studies evolution in an abstract, simplified setting, illuminating many of the complexities of environments, individuals, and genetic representations in the hope of uncovering the basic impacts of various processes on the dynamics of evolution. As a field of study, artificial evolution sits between the study of biological evolution and applied evolutionary computation. The study of biological evolution must attempt to model a wide range of natural factors including the complexity of DNA and its chemical reaction with enzymes producing specialized proteins all the way to interactions between individuals and environments. We are considering questions of developmental learning, dominance, and structured populations. Algorithmic graph theory considers extremal problems on graphs, determining optimal graph structures for given tasks or optimal algorithms on given graph structures. We are considering questions of graphs where distances reflect importance of vertices and which are resilient to certain forms of attack. Substructures that allow efficient group communication are also of interest.

Hornof is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Oregon. He joined the faculty in 1999 and was promoted with tenure in 2005. Dr. Hornof earned his Ph.D. in 1999 and his Master's degree in 1996, both from the University of Michigan, and both in Computer Science and Engineering. He received a B.A. in Computer Science from Columbia University in 1988. After college, he remained in New York City for five years (1988-1993) where he worked as an information technology specialist for Deloitte and Touche, and also part-time as a deejay at nightclubs such as Save the Robots and M.K. He also pursued mixed-media painting during these years, and his work was featured in group shows in New York City. In 1993, he redirected his creative and intellectual energies towards a career in academia, where he now integrates his interests in computing, human factors, and creative expression. Dr. Hornof is published in the leading human-computer interaction conference and journals, and has been awarded over $1.75 million in single-investigator research grants, including multiple awards from the National Science Foundation and the Office of Naval Research. Research Interests Dr. Hornof's research is in human-computer interaction. He is interested in making computers easier for people to use and learn, in finding new ways for people to use computers, and in supporting patterns of human creativity and expression. He has active research projects in cognitive modeling, eye tracking, and assistive technology. In Dr. Hornof's cognitive modeling research, he builds computer programs that simulate the human perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes that people use when interacting with a computer. The models incorporate, for example, the cognitive strategies that people use to find something on a computer screen, or to coordinate between two different tasks on a computer, or to use 3D audio cues assist a person in coordinating multiple tasks. The modeling work is useful to user interface designers because it can help them to understand how a person is likely to use a computer interface to accomplish a task. Cognitive modeling provides a scientific and engineering base to assist a designer in improving computer interfaces. Dr. Hornof uses eye tracking to evaluate and improve the accuracy of the cognitive models he develops. Most human-computer tasks involve some sort of eye movements, and the eye movements observed in an eye tracking experiment can show whether a model accurately simulates how people would do these tasks. For example, eye tracking can show whether a model accurately predicts how people skip over web page links of a certain color, such as links that are colored red to indicate that they have already been visited. Dr. Hornof also uses eye tracking for real-time input to a computer, to permit creative expression through eye movements, for two different target audiences. The first audience is children with severe motor impairments, for whom Dr. Hornof has developed EyeDraw, software that is now distributed with a commercial eye tracker and enables children with disabilities to draw pictures by just moving their eyes. The second audience is new media artists and musicians, with whom Dr. Hornof collaborates to develop eye-controlled compositions that have been performed at leading international computer music conferences. Dr. Hornof's research on assistive technology explores the difficult challenge of collaborating with children with severe disabilities, working directly with these children as partners in participatory design activities to develop systems that meet these children's developmental, communication, and creative needs.

His research covers a range of topics in statistical machine learning, including statistical relational representations, unifying learning and inference, and adversarial machine learning applications (e.g., spam filtering). He has received a Google Faculty Award, an ARO Young Investigator Award, and the best paper award at DEXA 2015. He also coauthored the book "Markov Logic: An Interface Layer for Artificial Intelligence" with Pedro Domingos, published by Morgan & Claypool. Research Interests Daniel Lowd's research is in statistical machine learning, with a focus on statistical relational learning and adversarial machine learning. These areas relax the traditional machine learning assumption that training examples are independent and identically distributed, and that future data will be drawn from the same distribution. Statistical relational learning focuses on the relationships among the examples, such as links among Web pages, friendship in a social network, or protein interactions in bioinformatics. This is done by by combining a relational representation, such as first-order logic, with a statistical representation, such as Markov or Bayesian networks. Adversarial machine learning deals with domains where an adversary is actively trying to evade detection. For example, spammers often try to disguise their emails by changing or adding words. By modeling the machine learning problem as a game, we hope to automatically build classifiers that are not so easily tricked.

Research Interests Dr. Proskurowski's research has been supported by grants from the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Sciences. As a Fulbright scholar, he has lectured in Finland. Supported by national research foundations he has collaborated abroad with researchers in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. Dr. Proskurowski's current research is in the area of graph theoretical and combinatorial algorithms. His main interest remains within the width parameters of graphs, especially as pertaining to embeddings and the design of efficient algorithms. Another sub-area of interest is that of modeling the topology of the Internet using graph-theoretical tools. This includes questions about centrality and monitoring of links and sites. Dr. Proskurowski's recent research involves also models of scheduling via coloring and labeling of graphs and hypergraphs.
